# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting and exploring the process of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.  

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified, analyzed, and documented.  

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Provide structured documentation of requirement analysis techniques.
- Highlight best practices for gathering, analyzing, and managing requirements.
- Serve as a reference guide for students, developers, and project managers.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of **identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders** for a software system. It acts as the foundation for designing, developing, and delivering software that aligns with user needs and business goals.

### Importance in SDLC
- **Clarifies Expectations:** Ensures that developers, stakeholders, and clients share a common understanding of what the system should do.  
- **Reduces Errors:** Helps identify potential issues early, lowering the risk of costly mistakes later in development.  
- **Improves Quality:** Leads to the creation of systems that meet user requirements and business objectives.  
- **Facilitates Communication:** Acts as a communication bridge between stakeholders, business analysts, and developers.  
- **Supports Project Planning:** Provides a clear scope and baseline for estimating time, cost, and resources.  

In short, Requirement Analysis is critical because it ensures that the final product is **relevant, efficient, and aligned with user expectations**.
