# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting and exploring the process of **Requirement Analysis** in software development.  

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are identified, analyzed, and documented.  

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Provide structured documentation of requirement analysis techniques.
- Highlight best practices for gathering, analyzing, and managing requirements.
- Serve as a reference guide for students, developers, and project managers.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of **identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders** for a software system. It acts as the foundation for designing, developing, and delivering software that aligns with user needs and business goals.

### Importance in SDLC
- **Clarifies Expectations:** Ensures that developers, stakeholders, and clients share a common understanding of what the system should do.  
- **Reduces Errors:** Helps identify potential issues early, lowering the risk of costly mistakes later in development.  
- **Improves Quality:** Leads to the creation of systems that meet user requirements and business objectives.  
- **Facilitates Communication:** Acts as a communication bridge between stakeholders, business analysts, and developers.  
- **Supports Project Planning:** Provides a clear scope and baseline for estimating time, cost, and resources.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is vital to the success of any software project. Without it, teams risk building systems that fail to meet user needs or business objectives. Key reasons include:

1. **Prevents Project Failures**  
   Poorly understood or undocumented requirements are among the top causes of software project failures. Requirement Analysis ensures the project has a clear scope, reducing misunderstandings and rework.  

2. **Saves Time and Cost**  
   Identifying issues during the requirement phase is far less expensive than fixing them later in development or after deployment. Clear requirements minimize changes, delays, and wasted resources.  

3. **Enhances User Satisfaction**  
   By thoroughly understanding user needs, the final product is more likely to meet expectations, leading to higher adoption rates, customer satisfaction, and long-term success.  

4. **Supports Better Decision-Making**  
   Well-documented requirements provide stakeholders with the information needed to make informed decisions about features, priorities, and resources.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The process of Requirement Analysis involves several structured activities that ensure requirements are properly identified, understood, and validated. The key activities are:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting initial information from stakeholders, customers, and other sources to understand the overall goals and expectations of the project.  

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques such as interviews, surveys, brainstorming, and workshops to uncover detailed requirements from stakeholders.  

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Clearly recording requirements in a structured format, such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use cases, to provide a reference for the entire team.  

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Examining requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and feasible. This may include creating models such as data flow diagrams, process models, or prototypes to visualize requirements.  

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and align with business objectives. Validation often involves reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping.

## Types of Requirements
Requirements in software development can broadly be categorized into two types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**. Both are essential to delivering a complete and effective system.

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define **what the system should do**. They describe the features, behavior, and functions of the system from the userâ€™s perspective.

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**
- The system should allow users to **create an account** and log in securely.  
- The system should allow customers to **search for available bookings** based on date, time, and service.  
- The system should enable users to **book, cancel, or reschedule** appointments.  
- The system should send **email or SMS notifications** to users upon successful booking or cancellation.  
- The system should generate **reports** for administrators, such as daily or monthly booking summaries.  

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define **how the system performs** rather than what it does. They describe system qualities, constraints, and performance expectations.

**Examples for the Booking Management Project:**
- The system should handle **up to 10,000 concurrent users** without performance degradation.  
- The system should respond to user queries within **2 seconds** under normal load.  
- The system should provide **99.9% uptime availability**.  
- The system must comply with **data privacy regulations** (e.g., GDPR).  
- The system should be **accessible** on both desktop and mobile devices with responsive design.
